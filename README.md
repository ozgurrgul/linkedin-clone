### What is this?

This project is a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) feed page clone made using `Next.js`. I made it responsive and as real as possible. It's also just hobby project, created over night using [Shadcn Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It's only client side rendering (there is no server side interaction). I also added a bit of similar behaviour of `Messaging` component exists in Linkedin.com for fun.

### Can I run locally?

Yes, clone the repo and then install deps:

``` bash
yarn
```

Then, run the project:

``` bash
yarn dev
```

### Will you develop this in future?

If I have time, and if people show interest, I can convert this to a more advanced Linkedin clone with Auth / Post / Commenting modules etc.
